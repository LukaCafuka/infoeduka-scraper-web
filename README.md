# Infoeduka scraper ASP.NET version
Web version of my python app for scraping stuff off of Algebra's student portal site <br>
If you know .NET then please help make this app better, this is the first time I am making an app in .NET, so the results will be probably terrible
### Todo
- ~~Create a message component instead of nesting it in the `Authentication.razor`~~
- ~~Create a cheking method in IeAuthentication for password an username~~
- Create the option to choose specific studies instead of downloading every material found
